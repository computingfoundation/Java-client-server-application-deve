**Android-client-server-application-development** is a resource of components functioning as an enterprise-ready foundation for Android client-server applications.

 It can be implemented into almost any new Android client-server application. Most of its development has consisted of researching, testing and implementing the most standard solutions.

The components it provides are the following:

1. A backend server application
2. An Android client application
3. A commons library

The following is a list of the application components it implements:

* User accounts (includes all standard features such as account settings and verification)
* Authentication
* Remote client configurations
* Application event messages
* Two-way SSL/TLS encryption
* Reusable UI widgets (e.g. a generic API-based info dialog)
* A generic base UI framework
* Generic client-server/REST model processing (provides base models as a starting point)
* Generic error management

Finally, it fully implements the following three databases:

1. PostgreSQL
2. Apache Cassandra
3. MongoDB

Generic setup script files are additionally provided for each one.

This project is the foundation of Android application [FencedIn](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fencedin.app).

---

Finally, it has been in development for three years and is still unreleased. Even though it is complete, it still needs to be finalized. Some source code files are provided from the backend and commons library components and the databases just as samples. Please note that many of these files have changed since they were uploaded in March.

Thank you.
